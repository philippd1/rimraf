> This is just a fork of @[rimraf]([rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf)) because i just had to.

For a proper documentation just use rimraf.

This was an experiment for releasing my first npm package.

## Usage
```
npm i -g yeeet
```
then, you can do...
```
yeeet <path> [<path> ...]
```
where `<path>` is the path to files or directories
